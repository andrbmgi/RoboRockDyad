Disassembly Instructions

Disassembly instructions

My Roborock Dyad had a clacking noise today which culminated in the big front brush not rotating anymore. From the noise I expected a stripped gear so I wanted to disassemble it but found absolutely no resources online. In here I want to document how to disassemble the lower part of the device to repair the problem.

(Optional) Disconnect the Neck

Pop off the red caps on both sides with a screw driver

Remove the two screw on each side
Remove the black cap from both sides
Press together the inner parts to detach the two parts (harder than it sounds!)

Open the Lower Housing

Remove the 9 screw that are marked in the picture
Use a spudger or screw driver to pop off the white upper housing

Remove the Side Cover of the Main Brush Drive Assembly

Remove one screw on the top and one on the inside of the brush housing as shown in the two pictures

Remove Main Brush Drive Assembly

Remove the two screws
Pull out the whole assembly to the side
Detach wires from motor (just pull them off)

You can replace this complete assembly including the motor with a new part from aliexpress (cost ~35 Euros).

I want to go deeper and find the root of the problem. So I removed the motor:

The gears in the planetary drive looked fine. Unfortunately the transmission assembly is glued together but it can be pried apart with little damage with a spudger and small flat head screw drivers.

I was surprised by the amount of dirt in the assembly.

The reason for the problem is now obvious. Some of the teeth were stripped from the belt, I find that quite surprising as these type of belts are nigh indestructible. 

Luckily its a standard part and can be ordered for around 4 Euros from ebay. Its a 6mm HTD 3M with a circumference length of 189mm. Search for ‘HTD 3M 6mm’, usually you can then choose the required length.

Cheers!
